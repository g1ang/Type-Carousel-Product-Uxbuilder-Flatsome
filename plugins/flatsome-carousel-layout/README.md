# Flatsome UX Builder Product Carousel Layout

This plugin adds a **Carousel** option to the Layout field of the Flatsome UX Builder **Product** element. When the layout is set to Carousel, the element renders its products inside the standard Flatsome slider so you get navigation arrows and bullets out-of-the-box.

## Installation

1. Copy the `flatsome-carousel-layout` folder to your WordPress site's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through **Plugins â†’ Installed Plugins**.
3. Open UX Builder, add or edit a **Products** element and pick **Carousel** from the **Layout** dropdown.

## Customisation

The plugin adds a `uxb-product-carousel` CSS class to the wrapper when the layout is active. Use it to apply additional styling if needed.
